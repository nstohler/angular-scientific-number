# angular-scientific-number
AngularJS directive for displaying and editing scientific numbers

This is my very first GitHub test project. So I'm trying stuff here in this little directive. No idea yet if I will use github much and contribute/update a lot here...

Trying to get this to work with WebStorm at the moment. And it looks like it's working ;)
